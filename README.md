# SystemVerilog | HDL Model Verification 
Welcome to the SystemVerilog HDL Model Verification Project! This repository contains a collection of SystemVerilog modules, testbenches, and example designs developed as part of the course **"Verification in HDL Models"** at the University of Tehran.

## Introduction
SystemVerilog is a powerful HDL used for modeling, designing, and verifying digital systems. This project is based on **section 7 "STRATEGIES FOR SIMULATION-BASED STIMULUS GENERATION"** of the book [**"Comprehensive Functional Verification: The Complete Industry Cycle."**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/2843495) It serves as a resource for learning and practicing SystemVerilog coding techniques, ranging from basic to advanced concepts. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced designer, you will find valuable examples and resources here.
